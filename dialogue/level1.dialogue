Barry: That old frog dude really seemed adamant that we deliver this package to him. I wonder what's in it?
Gertrude: Oh, I don't know, honey. It could be anything. A small price to pay for this wonderful rope though!
Barry: Yeah, I guess so. It's just weird that the #1 ranked rope-wrapper in the WORLD would give us this for free, albeit with a small delivery attached.
Gertrude: I know! This rope is reeeeaaalllly nice though, so let's get that package delivered ASAP!
