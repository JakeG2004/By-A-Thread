Barry: *rumble grumble*
Gertrude: Honey did you hear that rumbling??? I think there's an avalanche! Take cover!
Barry: The only avalanche around here is in my stomach!
Gertrude: Oh hahaha, A simple mistake! We're almost to the top. Just one more push and we're there! You can even see the smoke from the chimney from here!
Barry: WELL LET'S GET GOING THEN!!
